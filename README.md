This repo contains code/files written in Python

- [Anti-Money Laundering Model](https://github.com/PavChristian/jupyer_projects/blob/main/anti_money_laundering.ipynb)
This file contains code for preprocessing an AML dataset with over 5M transactions. I am using Graph Neural Networks to develop an algorithm that detects laundering activity activity. 
- [Fraud Detection Models](https://github.com/PavChristian/jupyer_projects/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb)
I utilize several classifier models (XGBoosting and LDA) as well as undersampling (for unbalanced data) that detect fraudulent activity.
