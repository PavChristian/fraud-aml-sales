# Jupyter projects
This repo contains code/files written in Python

- [Anti-Money Laundering Model](https://github.com/PavChristian/jupyer_projects/blob/main/anti_money_laundering.ipynb)
This file contains code for preprocessing an AML dataset with over 5M transactions. I am using Graph Neural Networks to develop an algorithm that detects laundering activity activity. 
- [Fraud Detection Models](https://github.com/PavChristian/jupyer_projects/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb)
I utilize several classifier models (XGBoosting and LDA) as well as undersampling (for unbalanced data) that detect fraudulent activity. 

- [Time-series analysis](https://github.com/PavChristian/fraud-aml-sales/blob/main/time_series.ipynb)
Time-series analysis for a Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rohlik-orders-forecasting-challenge/data?select=test.csv). Covers a period from 2020 to 2024 from 5 European warehouses. The notebook contains code that builds a time-series XGBoost model that predicts the number of orders.

- [A/B Testing](https://github.com/PavChristian/fraud-aml-sales/blob/main/ab_test_cookie.ipynb)
A/B testing notebook that analyze whether altering an in-game mechanic would have a statistically significant effect on the number of rounds played per each user.

- [Death records](https://github.com/PavChristian/fraud-aml-sales/blob/main/record_nn.py)
A neural network for classification (partially edited as I was not authorized to upload complete code)
